            <p><strong>Author:</strong>Coco Mellors</p>

            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> From the Sunday Times bestselling author of Cleopatra and Frankenstein
            </p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong>The Blue sisters have always been exceptional and exceptionally different. Avery, a strait-laced lawyer living in London, is the typical eldest daughter, though she hiding a secret that could undo her perfect life forever. Bonnie was a boxer but, following a devastating defeat, she's been working as a bouncer in LA, until one reckless night threatens to drive her out of the city. And Lucky, the rebellious youngest, is a model in Paris whose hard-partying ways are finally catching up with her. Then there was Nicky, the beloved fourth sister, whose unexpected death left Avery, Bonnie and Lucky reeling. When, a year later, the three of them must reunite in New York to stop the sale of their childhood home, they find that it's only by returning to each other that they can navigate their grief, addiction and heartbreak—and learn to fall in love with life again.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong> It was a beautiful evening. The wind gathered speed, lifting the frangipanis from the grove behind him, pink and yellow petals defying gravity. Beyond the trees, hidden by the foliage and rows of towering palm trees, the detention centre slept fitfully in the heavy summer heat. The palms blocked the ocean gust that now swirled around him, filling his lungs with the taste of temple flowers and salt. It reminded him of home. He took a deep breath, stepped off the escarpment and felt the red sand rush up towards him. After arriving in Australia seeking asylum, Fina dedicates herself to aiding the refugees held in a detention centre at Port Camden, a remote island outpost. Appalled by the mistreatment of those in custody, Fina speaks out to the media about the poor conditions within the facility, as a result she is arrested, taken from her home in the small country town of Hastings and threatened with deportation. When a security officer dies under suspicious circumstances, Lucky, a special investigator, arrives to uncover the truth. Her mystery is tied to Fina’s fate—and the secrets of the detention centre will divide the town and the nation.</p>

            <img src="book-cover3.jpg" alt="Book Cover 3" class="large-cover">
            <p><strong>Author:</strong>Ernesto Londono</p>
            <p><strong>Publication Year:</strong> 2024</p>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong>Family & Health</p>
            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> A moving, tender and thoughtful exploration of a complicated subject.</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong> When he signed up for a psychedelic retreat deep in the Brazilian rainforest, veteran New York Times journalist Ernesto Londono was so depressed that he had come close to attempting suicide just weeks earlier.

                To his astonishment, the nine-day ayahuasca experience provided Londono an instant reprieve from his depression and became the genesis of a personal transformation that anchors this sweeping exploration of the booming field of medicinal psychedelics.
                
                Londono's deeply researched and brilliantly reported account introduces readers to a dazzling array of psychedelic enthusiasts who are upending our understanding of trauma and healing. From Indigenous elders who regard psychedelics as portals to the spirit world to religious leaders using mind-bending substances as sacraments, as well as war veterans who credit psychedelics with alleviating their PTSD, and clinicians trying to resurrect a promising field of medicine hastily abandoned in when the War on Drugs was announced in the 1970s.
                
                Trippy is the definitive book of psychedelics and mental health today, an in-depth and nuanced look at this booming industry which makes sense of the perils, limitations and promise of turning to psychedelics in the pursuit of healing.</p>

The cultural pressures we face are ever expanding, my goal is to put you back in the driver's seat. You'll break free from self-censorship, learn to truly listen, cultivate new outlooks and build stronger, more authentic relationships with others, but most importantly, with yourself.</p>
